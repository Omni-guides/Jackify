# Contributing to Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux! We appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to help.

This project is currently maintained by Omni-guides, and for now, follows a "closed contribution" model.  This means that while the project is open-source and you are welcome to use, modify, and distribute it under the GNU General Public License v3.0 license, we are not actively accepting direct code contributions in the form of Pull Requests at this time.

We understand that you may have valuable suggestions and improvements.  If you would like to propose a change, enhancement, or bug fix, please open a new Issue describing your idea in detail.  This allows us to discuss the proposed changes, consider their impact, and determine the best way to implement them (if at all).  Providing clear and well-articulated Issues is the most effective way to contribute to the project's development.

**How to suggest changes:**

1. **Check for existing issues:** Before creating a new issue, please search the existing issues to see if your suggestion has already been discussed.  This helps avoid duplicate efforts and keeps the discussion focused.

2. **Open a new issue:** If no existing issue addresses your suggestion, open a new issue with a descriptive title and a clear explanation of your proposed change.  Include as much detail as possible, such as:

    * The problem you are trying to solve.
    * The proposed solution.
    * Any relevant code snippets or examples.
    * The benefits of your suggestion.
    * Any appropriate screenshots
    * Any appropriate log files (e.g. /home/user/omni-guides-sh.log or /home/user/wabbajack-via-proton.log)

3. **Be patient:** We will review your issue and respond as soon as possible.  Please understand that we may not be able to implement every suggestion, but we appreciate your input and will carefully consider all proposals.

**Why not Pull Requests?**

While we appreciate the effort involved in creating Pull Requests, managing and integrating external contributions requires significant time and consideration for what is already a time consuming task, as a hobbiest. Using Issues for suggestions allows us to have a structured discussion and plan changes more effectively.
